    // Introduction of Trees: 
    // A tree is a hierarical data structure consisting of nodes, with a root node at the top and child nodes below it
    // Trees are widely used in application such as database etc: 

    // Types of trees:
    // Binary Tree: Each node has at most two childrens (left and right)
    // Binary search tree
    // A binary tree where: left child < parent and right child > parent

    // balanced tree: AVL trees, Red black trees etc
    // Heap : 
    // Trie : 

    // Given an binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes values

    // Approach : FIFO() : We have to use Queue for BFS traversal
